SYSTEM_PROMPT = """###INPUT EXPLANATION:
The user will give you two types of input:
1. Transcriptions of an exam answer model with correct answers, and their awarded points, per correct answer component.
2. A JSON with question numbers, and their respective subquestions. The main object contains a single property named "questions". The value associated with "questions" is an array, which functions as a list of individual question entries. Each item within this "questions" array is itself an object, designed to hold the details for one main question. Within each of these question objects, there are two distinct properties: "question_number" and "sub_questions". The "question_number" is paired with a simple numerical value that identifies the question. The "sub_questions" property, in turn, holds another array. This nested array is a collection of objects, where each object represents a single sub-question belonging to the main question. Finally, each sub-question object has one property, "sub_q_text_content", which contains the actual text of the sub-question as a string value. This creates a hierarchical relationship where a primary list of questions can each contain their own list of more specific sub-questions.


###INPUT JSON EXAMPLE:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "sub_questions": [
        {
          "sub_q_text_content": "[FIRST SUBQUESTION TEXT PLACEHOLDER]",
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "sub_questions": [
        {
          "sub_q_text_content": "[FIRST SUBQUESTION TEXT PLACEHOLDER]",
        },
	{
          "sub_q_text_content": "[SECOND SUBQUESTION TEXT PLACEHOLDER]",
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

###TASK:
Your task is to take the transcriptions and the JSON file, and use it to create a more detailed JSON structure, you will need to introduce a new property inside each of the sub-question objects. Alongside the existing "sub_q_text_content", you would add a property named "model_alternatives". The value for this "model_alternatives" property is an array, designed to hold a list of different possible model answers for the sub-question. There can be one or multiple possible model answer alternatives for each sub-question. Each item within this "model_alternatives" array is an object that represents one complete, distinct answer. This individual answer object itself contains two properties: "alternative_number" and "model_components". The "alternative_number" is a numerical value that identifies which specific alternative answer it is (if there is only one possible alternative for a specific sub-question, this value should by default be 1). The "extra_comment" represents any extra comments made in the answer model. In the JSON this comment should be placed in the respective overall "model_alternative" as a whole, not to a specific answer component (even when the comment's content itself might relate to a very specific component). The "model_components" property holds yet another array, which breaks down that single answer into smaller, scorable parts. Each item in this final "model_components" array is an object representing one piece of the answer. Although, not always, sometimes there should only be one model component. There can be one or multiple model_components inside every alternative model answers, this means that you should only create multiple model components if the input transcription clearly does so. This component object has three properties: "component_text", which is a string containing the text for that specific partial correct answer; "component_points", a number indicating the score awarded for that component; and "component_order", a number that dictates the sequence of these components within the overall alternative answer, in the scenario that only one model component exists for a specific alternative answer, the value of "component_order" should be 1 by default.

###EXAMPLE:
Here is the base example JSON:

  "questions": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "sub_questions": [

    }
  ]
}

### SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING EXTRA COMMENTS:

The source transcription may contain extra comments or grading remarks, typically found after the answer components for a question. Your task is to accurately parse, rephrase, and place these comments into the correct `model_alternatives` object(s) using the `extra_comment` string property. Follow these rules precisely:

**1. Placement Logic: Where to put the comment?**

*   **Rule A: General Comments (Apply to All)**
    If a comment does not specify a particular answer alternative, it is a general remark. You MUST duplicate this comment and include it in the `extra_comment` property for **every** `model_alternative` within that sub-question.

*   **Rule B: Specific Comments (Apply to One)**
    If a comment explicitly refers to a single, specific answer alternative (e.g., "In the first answer alternative..."), you MUST place it **only** in the `extra_comment` property of that one `model_alternative`.

*   **Rule C: Compound Comments (Split and Distribute)**
    If a single comment from the source text addresses multiple alternatives with different instructions (e.g., 'For alternative 2 do X, and for alternative 4 do Y'), you MUST:
    a. **Split** the source comment into separate, distinct instructions.
    b. **Place** each distinct instruction into the `extra_comment` property of its corresponding `model_alternative`.

**2. Content Rephrasing: How to write the comment?**

*   **CRITICAL RULE: Remove All Alternative References in the Output.**
    When you place a comment into a specific `model_alternative`, you MUST rephrase it to **remove any mention of which alternative it belongs to**. The comment's position within the JSON already provides this context.

*   **Example of Splitting and Rephrasing:**
    *   **Source Comment:** "For the second answer component of the third alternative and for the fourth answer component of the fourth alternative, you may exclusively award either 0 or 2 points."
    *   **Your Action:** Split this into two parts and rephrase them.
    *   **Correct JSON Output:**
        *   Inside the object where `"alternative_number": 3`, you will add:
            `"extra_comment": "For the second answer component, you may exclusively award either 0 or 2 points."`
        *   Inside the object where `"alternative_number": 4`, you will add:
            `"extra_comment": "For the fourth answer component, you may exclusively award either 0 or 2 points."`

**3. Handling Mixed Comment Types**

*   A sub-question might have a mix of general and specific comments. Apply the rules above accordingly. General comments (Rule A) will be duplicated across all alternatives, while specific comments (Rules B & C) will only appear in their designated alternative after being rephrased.

*   **Example of Mixed Comments:**
    *   **Source Comments:**
        1. "In the first answer alternative, the third answer component should be mentioned explicitly."
        2. "If the candidate uses a different formula in the second answer component, do not deduct any points for this."
    *   **Your Action:**
        *   The first comment is specific to alternative 1.
        *   The second comment is general as it does not specify an alternative.
    *   **Correct JSON Output (assuming two alternatives):**
        *   Inside `"alternative_number": 1`:
            `"extra_comment": "The third answer component should be mentioned explicitly. If the candidate uses a different formula in the second answer component, do not deduct any points for this."`
        *   Inside `"alternative_number": 2`:
            `"extra_comment": "If the candidate uses a different formula in the second answer component, do not deduct any points for this."`


### FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS:
- The input transcription will very likely provide you with the overall question numbers before the contents of each respective correct model answer, but it might not tell you which correct answer fits to which specific sub question. This is for you to figure out.
- Some examples of when to provide multiple model alternatives is when the input text answer for that specific subquestion says something similar to "Either of the following", or it has multiple answer alternatives with "or" between them, or when it provides different alternatives already in writing (this was a non-exhaustive list of examples).
- If the input transcription gives only one model component and/or alternative for a sub question, you are perfectly allowed to only include one alternative answer and one component answer in your output, this is also done in the example JSON I gave you, in question number 2, for both sub questions.
- Some of the given text is not related to a specific model answers to specific questions. This content is noise and shouldn't be included in your output. That can include exam titles, page numbers, explanations on how to grade, etc.
- You might receive image files from the user, these represent any visual elements of the answer model. Place the filenames of those images inside the JSON in the appropriate question attribute within the "component_visual" key (e.g.: "component_visual": "page_4_graph_2.png"). The user will sequentially put the filenames below each respective image (file1 - filename1 - file2 - filename2 - etc.), to clarify which filename belongs to which image.
- For most answers, no visual will be given, in this case you can just omit the "component_visual" object. In case ONLY a visual is given, and no text, then you should omit "component_text" instead.
- If there are any mathematical/physics/etc. equations in the input transcription files, they will likely be written in the LaTeX syntax, and wrapped in either single or double dollar signs (for KaTeX library displaying on HTML pages). KEEP that syntax and the dollar sign wrapping, do NOT change it back to normal notation.
- When you include LaTeX code inside a JSON string value, you MUST escape all backslashes that are part of said LaTeX code snippets for correct JSON formatting. For example, the LaTeX `\\sin(t)` must be written as `\\\\sin(t)` in the final JSON output. The LaTeX `\\begin{cases}` must be written as `\\\\begin{cases}`. This is essential for the JSON to be valid. This is because In a JSON string, the backslash is a special character used to "escape" other characters. For example, to include a double quote (") inside a string, you write \". To include a literal backslash, you must escape it with another backslash, resulting in \\.
- Keep the original line breaks within the text when appropriate.
- Output in the original language as given by the user.
- DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SOLE JSON CONTENT."""

GRADING_RULES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
The user will input a document or a set of images with the correct answer model to an exam.
This document MIGHT contain a set of rules that you could hypothetically use to grade a written exam from a student. These rules are typically under the header of "General Rules" or "Subject-Specific Rules" (or under both these headers in separate paragraphs), or something similar.
What I want you to do is to fully transcribe these rules, and format them appropriately. Your output should only contain these sets of specific rules that you, as an LLM, could hypothetically later use to grade an actual exam. Also, it should always be in the English language. If the input content is in a foreign language, you should translate it to English. Your output should contain nothing else other than this.
CRUCIAL: It is imperative that you do not skip over anything relevant from the input content (you are not allowed to outputplaceholder text like "..." or "Placeholder for the rest..." or anything similary). Do not include any rules that are irrelevant to the actual work itself of grading an exam, but that are instead formulated with the goal of facilitating real-world processes and laws.
If the input document does not contain any of these relevant types of rules, you only have to output: There are no specified grading rules for this exam.
